# MoviesScraper

Class OmdbScraper: 
set the source file from which you want to take the movies titles, 
the destination file in which you want to save the json code,
the folder in wich you find the previous files,
and the api key from the omdb website.
Set in the "while" condition the number of get you want to do in the same execution. When you restart
the program, make sure you have uploaded the source file, because the program will again start the
titles' reading fro the top of the file.
